# Store-server
Web store built with Django
This is my first project on Django Framework. The project consists of 3 applications:
1) Products: responsible for all product objects in the store and basket functionality
2) Users: responsible for user accounts, registration, login processes and email verification
3) Orders: responsible for making orders and payment system via stripe

During the implementation I gained experience in:
* Django framework
* Class Based Views
* Django ORM
* Django Admin
* Mixins
* PostgreSQL, OAuth
* Testing (pytest, pytest-django)
* Caching (redis)
* Payment system (stripe)
* Project deployment (nginx, gunicorn, DigiralOcean, UFW)
